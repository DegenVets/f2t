    <h1>White Paper for <strong>Field 2 Table (f2t.io)</strong></h1>
    <h2>A Blockchain-Driven Marketplace Ecosystem with Dynamic NFT Access Control</h2>

    <div class="section intro">
        <p>Field 2 Table (f2t.io) is a decentralized marketplace designed to connect local food producers with consumers while ensuring compliance with regulations such as Cottage Food Laws. This updated vision incorporates blockchain solutions for farm shares, enabling producers to sell regulated goods and facilitate out-of-state sales by legally restructuring the transaction model. By combining farm share proof on the blockchain with NFTs and AWS-based RBAC/ABAC, f2t.io provides a transparent, scalable, and legally compliant ecosystem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Out-of-state sales and regulated goods like dairy, meats, and other perishable products are typically restricted under Cottage Food Laws. However, through farm share agreements, producers can legally extend their reach and offerings by allowing consumers to purchase "ownership" in their farm operations. Field 2 Table (f2t.io) integrates blockchain to provide transparent, immutable proof of farm shares, enabling compliance while broadening producer opportunities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Challenges in Current Marketplaces</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Compliance Gaps</span>: Existing platforms lack mechanisms to enforce location-based sales, transaction limits, and producer compliance.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Lack of Transparency</span>: Consumers cannot verify the origin or compliance of the goods they purchase.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Fragmented Access Systems</span>: Producers and regulators navigate multiple tools, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Field 2 Table (f2t.io)</strong> addresses this gap by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Employing blockchain for transparency and immutable compliance records.</li>
            <li>Using NFTs to store dynamic user attributes for decentralized identity and access control.</li>
            <li>Utilizing AWS RBAC/ABAC for secure, scalable access management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Challenges in Out-of-State and Regulated Sales</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Legal Barriers</span>: Direct sale of regulated goods like raw milk or meat products is often restricted across state lines.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Consumer Trust</span>: Lack of transparency in farm share programs can deter consumers.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Complex Recordkeeping</span>: Managing and tracking farm share agreements can be labor-intensive and prone to errors.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Proposed Solution: Blockchain-Based Farm Shares</h3>
        <p>By issuing digital proof of ownership via NFTs, f2t.io enables producers to sell farm shares that comply with legal frameworks for regulated goods and out-of-state transactions. Blockchain ensures transparency, traceability, and legal compliance while simplifying farm share management.</p>

        <h4>How Farm Shares Work in f2t.io</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Ownership Model</span>: Consumers purchase a fractional share of a producer’s farm operation. This share entitles them to a proportional amount of the farm’s products (e.g., raw milk, meat).</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Blockchain Integration</span>: Farm shares are represented as NFTs with encoded attributes, such as ownership percentage, entitled product type and quantity, and contract duration.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Out-of-State Sales Framework</span>: By legally defining consumers as part-owners of the farm, the transaction bypasses restrictions on direct sales across state lines. Blockchain provides immutable proof of ownership and product entitlement.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Key Features of Blockchain Farm Shares</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasis">NFT-Based Proof of Ownership</span>: Each farm share is minted as an NFT, with metadata encoding ownership details, shareholder rights, and expiration or renewal terms.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Smart Contracts for Compliance</span>: Enforce ownership rules, renewal schedules, and product distribution. Automate legal agreements and ensure transparency in ownership terms.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Geolocation Verification</span>: Validate consumer location to ensure compliance with any additional state-specific laws.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Regulated Goods Distribution</span>: Distribute regulated goods under the farm share framework while providing blockchain-backed proof of compliance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>How it Works</h3>
        <h4>Onboarding</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Producers and consumers register on f2t.io.</li>
            <li>An NFT module layer is minted for each user, encoding their role and attributes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Transaction Workflow</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Step 1</span>: A consumer places an order on the platform.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Step 2</span>: The system verifies compliance:
                <ul>
                    <li>Consumer location matches producer’s allowed region.</li>
                    <li>Producer’s transaction cap is within limits.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Step 3</span>: Producer fulfills the order, and the consumer confirms receipt via QR code or digital signature.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Step 4</span>: The transaction is logged on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and compliance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Regulator Oversight</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Regulators access immutable logs via read-only access.</li>
            <li>NFT attributes ensure that regulators only view data for their jurisdiction.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Enhanced Technology Stack</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Blockchain Layer</span>: Solana, Cosmos, or MultiVerseX for smart contracts and NFT minting.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">NFT Infrastructure</span>: Minting and managing dynamic NFTs with metadata that updates via off-chain events (e.g., compliance checks).</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">AWS Backend</span>: Combines RBAC for baseline permissions and ABAC for fine-grained control using NFT metadata.</li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">Geolocation APIs</span>: Ensure location-based compliance.</li>
            <li
