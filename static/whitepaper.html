    <h1>White Paper for <strong>Field 2 Table (f2t.io)</strong></h1>
    <h2>A Blockchain-Driven Marketplace Ecosystem with Dynamic NFT Access Control</h2>

    <p><strong>Field 2 Table (f2t.io)</strong> is a decentralized marketplace designed to connect local food producers with consumers while ensuring compliance with regulations such as Cottage Food Laws. This updated vision incorporates blockchain solutions for farm shares, enabling producers to sell regulated goods and facilitate out-of-state sales by legally restructuring the transaction model. By combining farm share proof on the blockchain with NFTs and AWS-based RBAC/ABAC, f2t.io provides a transparent, scalable, and legally compliant ecosystem.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Out-of-state sales and regulated goods like dairy, meats, and other perishable products are typically restricted under Cottage Food Laws. However, through farm share agreements, producers can legally extend their reach and offerings by allowing consumers to purchase "ownership" in their farm operations. <strong>Field 2 Table (f2t.io)</strong> integrates blockchain to provide transparent, immutable proof of farm shares, enabling compliance while broadening producer opportunities.</p>

    <h3>Challenges in Current Marketplaces</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance Gaps:</strong> Existing platforms lack mechanisms to enforce location-based sales, transaction limits, and producer compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Consumers cannot verify the origin or compliance of the goods they purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Fragmented Access Systems:</strong> Producers and regulators navigate multiple tools, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Field 2 Table (f2t.io)</strong> addresses this gap by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Employing blockchain for transparency and immutable compliance records.</li>
        <li>Using NFTs to store dynamic user attributes for decentralized identity and access control.</li>
        <li>Utilizing AWS RBAC/ABAC for secure, scalable access management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges in Out-of-State and Regulated Sales</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal Barriers:</strong> Direct sale of regulated goods like raw milk or meat products is often restricted across state lines.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer Trust:</strong> Lack of transparency in farm share programs can deter consumers.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Recordkeeping:</strong> Managing and tracking farm share agreements can be labor-intensive and prone to errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Proposed Solution: Blockchain-Based Farm Shares</h3>
    <p>By issuing digital proof of ownership via NFTs, <strong>f2t.io</strong> enables producers to sell farm shares that comply with legal frameworks for regulated goods and out-of-state transactions. Blockchain ensures transparency, traceability, and legal compliance while simplifying farm share management.</p>

    <h3>How Farm Shares Work in f2t.io</h3>
    <h4>Ownership Model:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Consumers purchase a fractional share of a producer’s farm operation.</li>
        <li>This share entitles them to a proportional amount of the farm’s products (e.g., raw milk, meat).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Blockchain Integration:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Farm shares are represented as NFTs with encoded attributes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Ownership percentage.</li>
            <li>Entitled product type and quantity.</li>
            <li>Contract duration.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4>Out-of-State Sales Framework:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>By legally defining consumers as part-owners of the farm, the transaction bypasses restrictions on direct sales across state lines.</li>
        <li>Blockchain provides immutable proof of ownership and product entitlement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Features of Blockchain Farm Shares</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NFT-Based Proof of Ownership</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Each farm share is minted as an NFT, with metadata encoding:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ownership details.</li>
                    <li>Shareholder rights (e.g., product access).</li>
                    <li>Expiration or renewal terms.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Smart Contracts for Compliance</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Enforce ownership rules, renewal schedules, and product distribution.</li>
                <li>Automate legal agreements and ensure transparency in ownership terms.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Geolocation Verification</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Validate consumer location to ensure compliance with any additional state-specific laws.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Regulated Goods Distribution</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Distribute regulated goods under the farm share framework while providing blockchain-backed proof of compliance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

                            <li>A producer can access their own sales data but cannot exceed transaction caps or modify compliance records.</li>
                            <li>Consumers can browse products within their geographic region.</li>
                        </ul>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How it Works</h3>
    <h4>Onboarding</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Producers and consumers register on f2t.io.</li>
        <li>An NFT module layer is minted for each user, encoding their role and attributes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Transaction Workflow</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> A consumer places an order on the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The system verifies compliance:
            <ul>
                <li>Consumer location matches producer’s allowed region.</li>
                <li>Producer’s transaction cap is within limits.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Producer fulfills the order, and the consumer confirms receipt via QR code or digital signature.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> The transaction is logged on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Regulator Oversight</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Regulators access immutable logs via read-only access.</li>
        <li>NFT attributes ensure that regulators only view data for their jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>
