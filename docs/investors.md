## Overview

### Cost Philosophy
- Pay-per-use serverless architecture
- Blockchain offloading for costly operations
- Strategic use of FedRAMP High services
- Optimization for cold/hot data patterns

### Monthly Base Infrastructure

| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| API Gateway | REST APIs with 1M requests | $3.50 |
| Lambda (Rust) | 1M invocations @ 128MB | $0.20 |
| DynamoDB | 5GB storage, 5 RCU/WCU | $13.35 |
| Neptune | db.r6g.large (minimal) | $245.28 |
| S3 | 50GB storage + transfers | $1.25 |
| CloudWatch | Basic monitoring | $0.00 |
| **Total Base Cost** | | **$263.58** |

## Service Cost Breakdown

### 1. API Gateway
```plaintext
REST API Costs:
- $3.50 per million requests
- $0.09/GB for data transfer out

Estimated Monthly Cost:
1M requests = $3.50
Data transfer (50GB) = $4.50
Total = $8.00/month
```

### 2. Lambda Functions
```plaintext
Rust Lambda Optimization:
- 128MB memory: $0.0000002083 per 100ms
- Average execution: 50ms
- Cold start optimization with custom runtime

Cost per million invocations:
1M × $0.0000002083 × (50ms/100ms) = $0.10
Total with 2M invocations = $0.20/month
```

### 3. DynamoDB
```plaintext
Provisioned Capacity:
- 5 RCU = $0.47/month
- 5 WCU = $2.38/month
Storage:
- 5GB × $0.25/GB = $1.25/month
Backup and Streams:
- Point-in-time recovery = $0.20/GB = $1.00/month
Total = $5.10/month
```

### 4. Neptune DB
```plaintext
Instance Costs:
- db.r6g.large = $245.28/month
- Backup storage = $0.021/GB
- I/O rate = $0.20 per 1M requests

Optimization:
- Use serverless Neptune when available
- Scale based on graph complexity
- Cache frequent queries
```

## Scaling Scenarios

```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Blockchain Offloading
```plaintext
Savings from blockchain offloading:
- User authentication: -$1,500/month (vs Cognito)
- Transaction validation: -$2,000/month (vs RDBMS)
- State management: -$1,000/month (vs Redis)
Total Monthly Savings: $4,500
```

### 2. Data Storage Optimization
```plaintext
Hot/Cold Data Strategy:
- Hot data in DynamoDB: $0.25/GB
- Warm data in S3: $0.023/GB
- Cold data in S3-IA: $0.0125/GB

Monthly Savings Example (100GB):
- All in DynamoDB: $25.00
- Optimized storage: $5.75
Savings: $19.25/month
```

### 3. Compute Optimization
```plaintext
Rust Lambda Benefits:
- 50% lower memory usage
- 30% faster execution
- Lower cold start times

Monthly Savings (1M invocations):
- Node.js: $0.40
- Rust: $0.20
Savings: $0.20/month per million invocations
```
